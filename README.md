Small example to use virtual Joystick with Cocos2D-X 3


Features
===============

1 - Converted SneakyInput converted to Cocos2D-X version 3

2 - Working project that make use of new components from Cocos2D-X version3

3 - Working version for: iOS, OSX and Android

TODO
===============

1 - Create a class Player that extends from Sprite (dont need show a real sprite, can be a box) and make it answer to events (move with joystick and jump with action button)

2 - Make the multi-resolution work. I tried it but dont work. In the project i have partial code on AppDelegate.

3 - Make the joystick support or enable the multi-touch events. I think that it already have, but i dont know in the version 3 of Cocos2d-X where is the method that enable it.
